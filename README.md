## Description

This budget tracker application lets you keep track of your expenses online and offline. If you lose internet connection, no worries! This app will still record your expenses and when an internet connection is established, it will send all of the stored, offline data to the database to be permanently stored. By using a Mongodb database and Mongoose, the user is able to add any money they have gained or spent and keep track of their expenses by means of a clean, interactive chart. This app utilizes MongoDB, Mongoose, IndexedDb, Express, Express router, Node.js, and more.
